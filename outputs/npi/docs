- Metadata
    - experiment: the name of the experiment (i.e. NPI)
    - env: the NPI environment in the dataset (i.e. quantifiers)
    - npi: the specific NPI appearing in the example
    - quantifier: the specific quantifier appearing in the example
    - licensor: is the NPI licensor present?
        - in this case, always a DE/UE quantifier like "every"
    - scope: is the NPI or its replacement in the scope of the licensor?
        - in this case, a relative clause modifying the subject
    - npi-present: is the NPI present?
